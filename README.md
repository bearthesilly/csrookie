# csrookie
This github repository aims to record my studying path in cs.

Recently interested in deep learning, currently preparing for the scientific research in the field of point cloud model.

I'm currently a student studying computer science in Shanghaitech University, freshman. Because of the motto "stay fool, stay hungry", I name my github repository 'csrookie' for, literally, I'm still a rookie in the field of cs.
