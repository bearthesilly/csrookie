# csrookie
This github repository aims to record my studying path in cs.

Recently interested in deep learning, currently preparing for the scientific research in the field of **point cloud** model. Recently getting prepared for the AAAI, 2024. 

In this repository, I will share as much resource as possible, including the slides, homework(if allowed to), and note, etc. Particularly, I will record my path of studying and researching in the field of deep learning.  

I'm currently a student studying computer science in Shanghaitech University, Sophomore. Because of the motto "stay fool, stay hungry", I name my github repository 'csrookie' for, literally, I'm still a rookie in the field of cs.
